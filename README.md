# Motorcycle Blog

This is a responsive motorcycle blog website built with HTML, Bootstrap 5, and custom CSS. It showcases different types of motorcycles (Cruiser, Sport, Adventure) with images and descriptions. The navbar is fully responsive and social media links open in new tabs. This project is ideal for learning Bootstrap-based layouts and responsive design.
